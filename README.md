## <p align=center><strong>Why was i made?</strong>

<p align=center>
This bot was made specifically for the use on a discord server I work on.<br>
After initially making the bot I thought it would be fun to <strong>open source</strong> ðŸ¥³ the code.<br>
Allowing for other developers to easily be able to see examples of different functions with dpy 2.0<br>
